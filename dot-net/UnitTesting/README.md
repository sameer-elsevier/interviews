# UnitTests

Objective:

Write a unit test for the UpdateLessonGrade method of the LessonService. Feel free to refactor the application as you feel necessary.

Steps:

- Clone this repo and create a branch using your name as the branch name.
- Write a unit test for the UpdateLessonGrade method of the LessonService.
- Send a pull request for your branch when you consider the assignment complete.

Additional Notes:

- Don't spend more than 45 minutes on this entire assignment.
- Feel free to describe why you made particular design decisions.
- Bare in mind this is a simplified program that does not persist data to a common data store. 
- The LessonRepository and ModuleRepository return data from a hardcoded list.
- The WriteUnitTest console application is an example application which lives in isolation, i.e. other applications do not reference it or it's functions.

Unit Test:(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) - In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.[1] Intuitively, one can view a unit as the smallest testable part of an application. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure. In object-oriented programming, a unit is often an entire interface, such as a class, but could be an individual method.[2] Unit tests are short code fragments[3] created by programmers or occasionally by white box testers during the development process. It forms the basis for component testing.[4]

Ideally, each test case is independent from the others. Substitutes such as method stubs, mock objects,[5] fakes, and test harnesses can be used to assist testing a module in isolation. Unit tests are typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended.
